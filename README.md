## Overview

### Description

I present to you a small project I made. The main objective was to work with HTML, CSS and Flexbox to perfect my knowledge with those technologies.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Thanks to this project, I've practiced some semantic HTML, CSS and Flexbox. The following snippets are some examples of the knowledges I used.

- Semantic HTML5 (`<select>`):

```html
<select id="size" name="size">
  <option value="50-100">1 - 50 employees</option>
  <option value="100-200">50 - 100 employees</option>
  <option value="200+">100+ employees</option>
</select>
```

- CSS (`select`):

```css
select {
  appearance: none;
  background-image: url("./assets/Expand_down.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: 95%;
}
```

- Flexbox (`.last`):

```css
.flex {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued Development

Seeing how Flexbox simplify webpage organization, I will continue to master these technologie.
I will do that by using those on other project, notably to make responsive website.
